## Full-Stack Software Developer Take-Home Project: Patient Management Dashboard

This project is the first step in our technical interview process, designed to assess your full-stack development skills, with a particular focus on UI/UX and code quality.

### Project Goal
Build a user-friendly, web-based application that allows healthcare providers to efficiently manage critical patient data.

### The Problem & Required Functionality
Healthcare providers are currently using outdated patient management dashboards and require a new, improved solution. Your application should allow providers to:

1. **Input Patient Data**: Enable providers to enter the following patient information:
   - Names: First Name, Middle Name (Optional), Last Name
   - Date of Birth
   - Status: Select from a predefined list (Inquiry, Onboarding, Active, Churned)
   - Address: Full street address (consider separate fields for street, city, state/province, zip/postal code if it enhances UI/UX)

2. **View Patient Data**: Provide a clear and intuitive way for providers to view all entered patient data. This could be a list, a table, or a dashboard view.

### Technical Solution & Architecture
Your solution should demonstrate a standard web application architecture, consisting of:
- **Front-End**: A client-side application (e.g., using React, Angular, Vue, etc.) that handles user interaction and data presentation.
- **Back-End with APIs**: A server-side application (e.g., using Node.js, Python/Flask/Django, Ruby/Rails, etc.) that exposes APIs for the front-end to interact with.
- **Database**: A persistent data store (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebase, etc.) that the back-end uses to store and retrieve patient information.

### Key Technical Considerations:
- **Leverage Libraries & Frameworks**: We encourage you to use popular component libraries, UI frameworks, and existing development tools to streamline implementation. The goal is not to "reinvent the wheel."
- **API Design**: Consider how your front-end will communicate with your back-end effectively.
- **Data Persistence**: Ensure data entered is correctly stored and retrieved from the database.

### Important Notes & Expectations
- **Ambiguity & Questions**: This prompt is intentionally ambiguous in certain areas. We highly encourage you to ask questions about any assumptions you need to make or details you’d like clarified. Your ability to ask thoughtful questions is part of the evaluation process and demonstrates a deeper understanding of product development.
- **Time Estimate**: While we’ve seen similar projects completed in 2-3 hours on average, please take the time you need to create a solution you are genuinely proud of. Quality over speed is key.
